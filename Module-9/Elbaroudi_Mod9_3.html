    <p> President Whitmore's Speech </p>

    <p> Good morning. Good morning. In less than an hour aircrafts from here will join others from around the world and you will be launching the largest <span id = "aerial">_________</span>  battle in the hitory of mankind.</p>

       <p> Mankind, that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common <span id = "interests">_________</span>. Perhaps it's fate that today is the 4th of July and you will once again be fighting for our freedom not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution but from annhilation.</p>

       <p>We're fighting for our right to live, to exist, and should we win today the 4th of <span id = "July">_________</span> will no longer be known as an American holiday but as the day when the world declared in one voice, wWe will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without a fight. We're going to live on. We're going to survive. Today we celebrate our <span id = "Independence">_________</span> Day!</p>
